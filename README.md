This is a microstructure generator that outputs an HDF5 file with the grain structure and the orientations.

Things to be added:
 - Fix HDF5 writer so that a software can read it
 - Verify quaternion euler angle converter
 - More texture customization (add in texture components as well as custom textures)
 - Custom grain size generation
 - Verify 3D works with the example
 -
