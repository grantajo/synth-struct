This is a microstructure generator that outputs an HDF5 file with the grain structure and the orientations.

Things to be added:
 - Fix failing test with test_microstructure
 - Fix HDF5 writer so that a software can read it
 - Custom grain size generation
 - Verify 3D works with the example
 - Function to get all grain IDs for a specific region
 -
